== Fetching the document

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/glossarist/iev-document
----


== Installing Build Tools

See https://www.metanorma.com/author/topics/install/


== Running via Docker or locally

If you have installed the build tools locally, and wish to run the
locally-installed compilation tools, there is nothing further to set.

If you don't want to deal with local dependencies, use the docker
version by:

[source,sh]
----
export METANORMA_DOCKER=metanorma/metanorma
----

The `Makefile` will automatically choose the proper command to
execute.


== Building The Document

[source,sh]
----
make all
----

The Makefile will first populate the sources/data directory.

The following outputs will be built:

* Document index at `documents.html`
* IEC 60050-192 at `documents/iec-60050-192.html`
* HTML (`[filename].html`)
* PDF (`[filename].pdf`)
* Word DOC (`[filename].doc`)


== Iterating the document

[source,sh]
----
make
open documents/document.html
----
