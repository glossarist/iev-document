== Normative References

// It is necessary to include the Normative references clause for conformity with the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. However, since the IEV is managed as a database, cite any normative reference in the terminological entry concerned. UNLIKE the IEV advice, do add any normative reference in the terminological entry concerned; but they will not be rebdered.
