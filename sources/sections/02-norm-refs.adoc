== Normative references

// It is necessary to include the Normative references clause for conformity with
// the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. However, since the IEV is managed as a database,
// cite any normative reference in the terminological entry concerned. UNLIKE the
// IEV advice, do add any normative reference in the terminological entry
// concerned; but they will not be rendered.
